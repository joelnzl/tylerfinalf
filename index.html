                                released on July 21, 2017, by Columbia Records. Produced entirely by Tyler, the
                                album features guest vocals from a range of artists, including Frank Ocean, ASAP
                                Rocky, Anna of the North, Lil Wayne, Kali Uchis, Steve Lacy, Estelle, Jaden

                                received widespread acclaim from critics for its smoothness, unique blend of
                                genres, collaborations and its production. It debuted at number two on the US
                                Billboard 200. The album was named among the best albums of 2017 and the decade
                                by multiple publications and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2018 Grammy
                                Awards.</p>
